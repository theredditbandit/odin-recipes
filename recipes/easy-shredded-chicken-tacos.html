    <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>This is a great recipe for easy shredded chicken tacos that I've been using for years.</p>
   <p> Great for a weeknight or a weekend meal!</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white distilled vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds skinless , boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>8 taco shells , warmed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix water and taco seasoning in a large bowl. Add tomato sauce, vinegar, garlic, oregano, cumin, and sugar; mix well.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Add tomato sauce mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken breasts from the pan and shred meat with 2 forks when cool enough to handle. Return shredded chicken to the pan with the tomato sauce. Cook and stir until chicken is coated with sauce and sauce reduces a bit, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken and sauce to a serving bowl and spoon onto taco shells.</li>
    </ol>
